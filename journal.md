#Introduction
Hayword et al (1999) made some great measurements of BBOA over the Sahara.
We add to these measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectrometer (Allen et al 2000).

#Simulations
John has made some simulations of particle formation using his box model/
IT reproduces the growth in sze distribution observed and suggests coagulation as the dominant method of growth.
